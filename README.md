# YourMood

This application's goal is to enable its user to take control of his/her mood and to gain a better understanding of his/her feelings. This Python script utilizes text files to store persistent data that remains after the script has closed. It supports several moods with easy expandability. 

## Motivation

I wanted to write this script because I was interested in working with external files using Python. I became interested after learning about databases and SQL. The idea for the application was something that I wanted to create in the past, but I never had the skills to do so. Now that I have learned enough about programming to make this application, I will be using it daily to manage my mood.

## What I learned

During the development of this application, I learned about working with external files in Python. I also did research into SQL and SQLite3, but found that these tools would not be appropriate for the project I had in mind. However, I may utilize them in the future. This project also allowed me to practice my Python programming skills such as working with while loops, using if/else statements, and keeping my code Pythonic and clean using with statements for exception handling.

### Installing

Make sure the .exe file or .py file is in a folder, as it will create text files in the directory it is placed in. While this is not necessary, having all of the files in a folder may be easier to organize/keep track of.
